## Running

* The idea is to have a random number generator.
* The home page show two lines and a button:
  - line 1: value retrieved by liveview
  - line 2: value retrieved by alpinejs
  - button to generate the number (liveview)
* You have a button to get a random number and until this number arrives from backend
alpinejs show some random numbers (for now from an array but trivial to change) in
quick succession, updating them every 100ms until the value generated by the backend arrives and
stop this process.
